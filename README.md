# XMchallenge
### Description
Itâ€™s time for XM developers to invest their salaries on cryptos. The problem is that we have no
idea of cryptos, so we are feeling a little bit afraid which crypto to choose. But is this actually a
problem? Of course not! We are developers and we always implement solutions for all the
problems we face.
For this one, we decided to build a recommendation service.
